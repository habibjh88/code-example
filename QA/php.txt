Q. What is stopPropagation and preventDefault
stopPropagation: prevents further propagation of the current event in the capturing and bubbling phases.

preventDefault: prevents the default action the browser makes on that event.

Event Delegation : Event Delegation is basically a pattern to handle events efficiently. Instead of adding an event listener to each and every similar element, we can add an event listener to a parent element and call an event on a particular target using the .target property of the event object.
