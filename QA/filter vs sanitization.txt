Validation – These are the checks that are run to ensure the data you have is what it should be. For instance, that an e-mail looks like an e-mail address, that a date is a date and that a number is (or is cast as) an integer 

(you can restrict user input so that the user can input by input validation the exact formatted value like phone, email, etc. )

Sanitization / Escaping – These are the filters that are applied to data to make it 'safe' in a specific context. For instance, to display HTML code in a text area it would be necessary to replace all the HTML tags by their entity equivalents
